    "## Logistic Regression\n",
    "Now we are switching from regression problems to classification problems. Don’t be confused by the name “Logistic Regression”; it is named that way for historical reasons and is actually an approach to classification problems, not regression problems.\n",

    "## Classification\n",
    "Instead of our output vector y being a continuous range of values, it will only be 0 or 1.\n",

    "$$\\large\n",
    "y\\in \\{0,1\\}\n",

    "We’re only doing two classes for now, called a _**“Binary Classification Problem”**_.\n",
    "\n",
    "One method is to use linear regression and map all predictions greater than 0.5 as a 1 and all less than 0.5 as a 0. This method doesn’t work well because classification is not actually a linear function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if we are trying to build a spam classifier for email, then $x^{(i)}$ may be some features of a piece of email, and $y$ may be $1$ if it is a piece of spam mail, and $0$ otherwise. Hence, $y\\in \\{0,1\\}$. $0$ is called the negative class, and 1 the positive class, and they are sometimes also denoted by the symbols \"&#8722;” and “&#43;” Given $x^{(i)}$, the corresponding $y^{(i)}$ is also called the label for the training example.\n",

    "# Regularization\n",
    "## The Problem of Overfitting\n",
    "Consider the problem of predicting $y$ from $x\\in \\mathbb{R}$. The leftmost figure below shows the result of fitting a $y=\\theta_0+\\theta_1x$ to a dataset. We see that the data doesn’t really lie on straight line, and so the fit is not very good.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Overfit](./Week3_Images/overfit1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, if we had added an extra feature $x^2$, and fit $y=\\theta_0+\\theta_1x+\\theta_2x^2$, then we obtain a slightly better fit to the data (See middle figure). Naively, it might seem that the more features we add, the better. However, there is also a danger in adding too many features: The rightmost figure is the result of fitting a $5^{th}$ order polynomial $y=\\sum _{j=0}^{5} \\theta _{j} x^{j}$. We see that even though the fitted curve passes through the data perfectly, we would not expect this to be a very good predictor of, say, housing prices (y) for different living areas (x). Without formally defining what these terms mean, we’ll say the figure on the left shows an instance of **underfitting** — in which the data clearly shows structure not captured by the model—and the figure on the right is an example of **overfitting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "__*Underfitting*__, or high bias, is when the form of our hypothesis function h maps poorly to the trend of the data. It is usually caused by a function that is too simple or uses too few features. At the other extreme, _**overfitting**_, or high variance, is caused by a hypothesis function that fits the available data but does not generalize well to predict new data. It is usually caused by a complicated function that creates a lot of unnecessary curves and angles unrelated to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This terminology is applied to both linear and logistic regression. There are two main options to address the issue of overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reduce the number of features:\n",
    "    - Manually select which features to keep.\n",
    "    - Use a model selection algorithm (studied later in the course).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Regularization\n",
    "    - Keep all the features, but reduce the parameters $\\theta_j$.\n",
    "    - Regularization works well when we have a lot of slightly useful features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cost Function\n",
    "If we have overfitting from our hypothesis function, we can reduce the weight that some of the terms in our function carry by increasing their cost.\n",

    "\n",
    "We’ve added two extra terms at the end to inflate the cost of $\\theta_3$ and $\\theta_4$. Now, in order for the cost function to get close to zero, we will have to reduce the values of $\\theta_3$ and $\\theta_4$ to near zero. This will in turn greatly reduce the values of $\\theta_3x^3$ and $\\theta_4x^4$ in our hypothesis function. As a result, we see that the new hypothesis (depicted by the pink curve) looks like a quadratic function but fits the data better due to the extra small terms $\\theta_3$ and $\\theta_4$.\n",
